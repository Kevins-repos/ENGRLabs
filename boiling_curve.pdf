excessTemp(variable that will promt the user to input the temperature)

steps
    check first for excessTemp being within bounds
    if it is, go through each temp range to decide which one excessTemp belongs to and set the variables for that range
    check for free convection

test cases
    out of bounds
        excessTemp = 1.2
            expected "Surface heat flux is not available" 
        excessTemp = 1201
            expected "Surface heat flux is not available"
    value error
        there shouldnt be a divided by zero error as there are no holes in the graph but should be handled anyways
    type error
        excessTemp = '1'
            expected "Surface heat flux is not available"
        excessTemp =         33    
            expected "The surface heat flux is approximately {calculated number} W/m^2
    math
        excessTemp = 1*5
            expected "The surface heat flux is approximately {calculated number} W/m^2
    typical cases  
        excessTemp = 1.3
            expected "The surface heat flux is approximately {calculated number} W/m^2
        excessTemp = 5
            expected "The surface heat flux is approximately {calculated number} W/m^2
        excessTemp = 10(should be underapproximation, y<100000)
            expected "The surface heat flux is approximately {calculated number} W/m^2
        excessTemp = 30
            expected "The surface heat flux is approximately {calculated number} W/m^2
        excessTemp = 120
            expected "The surface heat flux is approximately {calculated number} W/m^2
        excessTemp = 12000
            expected "The surface heat flux is approximately {calculated number} W/m^2
