Here are the instructions for playing the board game Ludo:
*****Setup*****
2â€“4 players choose a color and place their four tokens in the corresponding starting area.
*****Gameplay*****
Players take turns rolling a die to move their tokens around the board clockwise:
    Rolling a six: A player can move one token out of the starting area and onto the board. They also get an extra roll.
    Moving tokens: The number on the die determines how many spaces a token can move.
    Landing on an opponent's token: The opponent's token is sent back to the starting area.
    Landing on your own token: The tokens form a block, making them safe from opponents.
    Reaching the home column: A player must use an exact roll to move a token into their home column.
    Winning: The first player to move all four tokens into their home column wins.
